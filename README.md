# Chocolate Sales Analysis(Interactive dashboard in Excel)
## About Project
The data set used for this project is a simple one gotten from kaggle. The analysis is done in Excel and Pivot table is the major tool used. I added an extra column with a little calculation to the source data to get the approximate unit price of each product. Pivot table keeps the sheet tables linked to the source sheet, hence, every change(addition, deletion or editing) done on the source data will automatically be updated on all tables and charts.
